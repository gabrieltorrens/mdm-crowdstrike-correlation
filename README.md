# mdm-crowdstrike-correlation
This notebook does correlation between your Kandji, Intune, Crowdstrike, and AssetPanda devices.

### Usage
This script was written at a weird time when I had UI access to SaaS tools but no API keys.
Download device data from your SaaS platfroms and save the CSV files with the below names and in a directory named 'data'.
intune = data/intune.csv
kandji = data/kandji.csv
cshosts = data/crowdstrike.csv
assetpanda = data/assetpanda.csv
